## Introduction

This repository contains the configuration files for my personal development environment.

The idea is to have a single repository with all the configuration files for my development environment, so that I can easily set up a new machine with all the tools and configurations I need with the below principles in mind

- Reproducible
- Version Controlled
- Immutabe
- Secure
- Portable
- Scalabe
- Flexible
- Maintainable

## Pre-requisites

The following software must be installed on your system:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Python3](https://www.python.org/)
- [ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)
- [docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [podman](https://podman.io/) - To leverage the built image

## Installation

To install the configuration files, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://psadi/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles

export ANSIBLE_CONFIG="${PWD}/ansible/ansible.cfg"
export ANSIBLE_INVENTORY_WARNING=False

# Remember vault password file at ansible/.vault_pass
export ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE=ansible/.vault_pass

ansible-playbook ansible/site.yaml
```
## Docker Environment

A docker image is available with all the tools and configurations pre-installed. To use the docker image, run the following commands:

```bash
docker run -it psadi/pde:latest
```

A shell [script](https://github.com/psadi/dotfiles/blob/main/.local/bin/devsh) is available to run the docker image with optional arguments to be passed during runtime.

***Pre-requisite:** dotfiles to be cloned to the home directory & configured as per the above instructions*

To Invoke the script, run the following commands:

|INVOKE TYPE|COMMAND|
